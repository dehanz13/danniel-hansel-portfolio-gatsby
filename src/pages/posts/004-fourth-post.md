# **How To Adapt A Happy, More Fulfilling Life**


This is my story on how I was able to change my unhappy life and transform it into a happier, healthier, more fulfilling life. It was a fun journey for me as this is just the beginning of my new chapter in my life.

My main goal is to help some of you that have or had struggles (like me) to overcome your fears, failures and reach your highest potential. So, your remaining time in this life can be better  and you will be able to achieve anything you want in life.

_Life is a learning experience but take it with a grain of salt._

Everyone has their own problems in life. Everyone’s journey is different but there would always be lessons to be learned. And once we acknowledge it and learn from it, we can understand and find a better approach on how to go about any obstacle the next time we encounter it.

One of my mentors (that I still listen and learn from to this day and moving forward) is Jim Rohn. As I will quote a lot of his great affirmations on this post. (I have a list of other great mentors that have taught me well here … ____) 

Okay, this is the moment you have been waiting for… So, let’s jump right into it.

Here is a list of things that have helped me and you can do too! (in no particular order):

### Develop A Morning Routine

Everyone has a routine that works for them. Develop your own morning routine so that you can create a successful week. By develop these powerful morning habits, not only you will increase productivity, but you will also increase your self-esteem which brings happiness  

*“Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.”*

Once you have developed a morning routine, by applying this routine every day of your life, it will become a habit which turns into a lifestyle. A healthy, happy and more fulfilling lifestyle. This brings me to the next point, self-discipline.

### Self-Discipline

The people who succeed in any situation have a pattern of what they do to succeed. Whether it’s in business context, relationship, doesn’t matter what the environment is. However, one thing in common that they all have is self-discipline. Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced every day.

*“Everyone must choose one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret.”*

If you are one of the people who struggles with this, don’t worry. I have a solution for you: Start from the smallest things AND have interest in them. Do them good and Master them. Then move on to the next one. Everyone has to start somewhere right? Well, this is how I was able to start to better myself. You’ve got to take consistent, MASSIVE Action and only then you will begin to build unstoppable momentum towards your goal that no one could stop you from anything.

*“Affirmations without discipline is the beginning of delusion.”*

Let go of your anger, annoyance and resentment when avoidance is NOT an option.

### Be Grateful

This has been a huge impact on my life as I am continually growing and learning. I start my morning every day by practicing gratitude. By going through this gratitude process, your brain will thrive, but you will also appreciate the things you already have. Otherwise, you will not be given the things that you really want.

*“There’s no better opportunity to receive more than to be thankful for what you already have. Thanksgiving opens the windows of opportunity for ideas to flow your way.”*

### Identify Your Bad Lifestyle Habits and CHANGE them!

I used to complain and blame everything around me like my job, the government, the weather until I heard my mentor’s quote that really changed my life:

*“For things you change, you have to change.” - Jim Rohn*

Then, I used to procrastinate a LOT when I was in college because I was lazy and always feel overwhelmed when it comes to learning new things. Until I realized that once adulthood hits, nothing will be given to you anymore. If this is you, I have great news for you.

To overcome this, it’s quite simple and easy. Just break it down to few simple steps and make one step at a time. Discipline yourself to make just the first step… then the second… then the third and before you know it, this becomes systematic, you’ll build a momentum, and you will keep going! Say to yourself, “like I should do it? I could do it? and I will do it! No more would I let neglect let me down!” 

Start doing the push-ups or the things that you have been postponing. Make progressive progress every day. And you will realize that your self-esteem is getting higher and higher and you will be happier each day.

### Constantly Work on Yourself

As Jim Rohn says, *“It’s not about what you are getting. It’s about Who you are Becoming (through the process.)”*

Ever since I had started my journey to become the best I could become, I am always determined to keep working and investing in myself, every single day. I do believe that even if my destination is still far away, by keep working day and night, I will eventually get closer to my goals each day. I would always remind myself to Go home smarter than I came, go home with more ideas than I came.

This is also a great opportunity to master your Time Management skill. Once you know what you want(desire), your brain will work towards it(determination). You will eventually dedicate your time into something worth. Let’s say you’re driving to work, go find a podcast that will teach you something. Maybe a new skill that you’ve been wanting to learn or adopt or maybe a new concept that you need a better understanding about. 

*“Don’t spend major time in minor things.” – Jim Rohn*

Use your time wisely. To work on yourself, invest in yourself. Don’t be casual in learning. Work to keep adding value to yourself so you would be attractive to the marketplace and next thing you know, you have opened up more doors of opportunity. I always remind myself to Work harder on myself than I do at my job. And to also learn from other people as you simply can’t experience everything. Taking the time to recognize the experiences, the successes and failures of others can help you achieve what you want in life.”

### Take Care Of Yourself

When you are constantly working, whether in yourself or on your job, you also need to consider your health as an important factor. Not taking care of yourself will result and put you in a bad spot because if you get sick, not only that’ll stop you from working towards your goals but also it could cost you a crazily amount of money in the long run. 

*“Take care of your body. It’s the only place where you have to live.” – Jim Rohn*

The benefits you’d get from taking care of yourself are huge. You would start feeling better about yourself which improves your self-confidence and self-love. You would also feel good every day because your body is healthy. Start by a few simple disciplines every day. Maybe take a walk around the block, eat an apple a day, or going to the gym for 30 minutes a day. Start yourself a new fresh day that could make the rest of your day better.

*“Either you run the day or the day runs you.” – Jim Rohn*

### Ask Better Questions

Lastly, you need to ask better questions to yourself. I used to think “Why do I suck at (something). Why am I like this?” Then part of my brain gives me an answer that negatively affects me emotionally and mentally. Then I discovered that the way the brain works is like playing fetch with your dog. When you fetch your dog a stick, guess what? It will fetch it back to you, consistently and almost every time.

Now you might ask, how does that relate to how our brains work? Well, when you ask a lousy question, your brain will automatically fetch a lousy answer. Instead, you can ask, “How could I do better? How could I improve to be better? What do I need to do to solve this problem?” By practicing this technique every day, not only your brain will be trained to think on a higher level but it will also systematically start to ask good questions and in result? It will bring you useful ideas and thoughts. 

Just remember, there is also the other side which I call it the Negativity side. This is the part of the brain that will fetch answers coming from doubts, worry, etc and they will take everything good that you’ve created and they will take it all away. That is why you need to always, stand guard at the door of your own mind. This side is what causing most people to quit. 

Thank you for reading my post! Hope you can get something and learn from my experience!
