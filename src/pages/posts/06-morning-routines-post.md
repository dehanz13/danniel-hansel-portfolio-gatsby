How to Build Powerful Morning Routines that Will Change Your Life

Have you ever wondered why so many successful people are able to achieve anything in their life? I have and I am pretty sure you have as well otherwise, you would not be reading this blog right now. If you are looking for some ways to improve your life, you have come to the right place! 

I wrote this blog because I realized that ever since I have graduated college, many people including me are struggling to find ways to improve their lives. Based on my experience, the only thing that could change and improve anyone’s life towards the better is by developing good habits. I know that might sound biased but in reality, habits are the things that we do every day without any conscious thought. Whether it is a good habit or bad habit, by performing a habit through repetition, our body automatically respond to our environment without us even knowing it.

I used to spend my days aimlessly scrolling through Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Read emails when I really didn’t need to, and watch YouTube videos just to go through the day. Now, however, after I’ve established and followed my own morning routine, I realized that I had spent most of my time procrastinating, mindlessly consuming content that gives me no value and in return, I produce no results for myself. Therefore, I decided to write this blog hoping to help someone out there who is in the same position as me.

In this blog, I have listed my morning routine that have worked for me and improved my life as well as my health and mental. Before you consider starting any of this routine, ask yourself, “Am I happy? What kind of life do I want? Am I designing my own lifestyle or am I just living someone else’s? What are my goals? Am I going to do whatever it takes to achieve those goals and become someone that I’ve always wanted?” Ask yourself these questions and be honest to yourself.

Before we start, here are some pros and cons to consider… But don’t let it scare you. Just remember: 

“Everyone must choose one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret.” – Jim Rohn


Pros & Cons

Pros of developing these habits are substantially huge and might be one of the biggest ROI (Return of Investment) that you could ever have in your life. When I adopted this healthy lifestyle, I was amazed by how I was able to stay and be productive when I needed to be, I felt very energetic throughout the day, I was able to work 75-80 hours every week without any complaint, I see the world with a much broader perspective, I become more open-minded to everything, I am inspired and driven more than ever, and my mind is clearer and calmer which makes it easy for me to eliminate any negative self-talk and put my focus on something else more important that will make me happy.

“Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced every day.” – Jim Rohn

However, this might sound easy to some of you but the only con that comes with it is, it requires Self-Discipline. If you think you have mastered self-discipline, these routines might not sound too bad to you after all. In fact, what’s holding most people to reach their full potential and their goals is the Discipline to put in the Work and the Action. But once you start this process that we call “Personal Development”, your life will eventually get better and you will start to notice changes in your life which I’d like to call, “Miracles.”

My Current Morning Routine

7AM – Get freshened up.
(5-min) – I recall my dreams and record any important dream on my notes
(15-min) - I wake up and head straight to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my face with cold water.
(10-min) - I make my bed, drink a bottle of water then brew my coffee.
7:30AM – Getting myself ready (mentally).
(5-min) - Practice breathing exercise
(15-min) - Meditate
(5-min) - Quick exercise to get the blood pumpin’ and flowin’.
(5-min) – Read & Review my goals for today, each week and for that particular month.
8:00AM – Getting myself ready (physically).
(5-min) - I take my cold shower
(5-min) - Walk around the block.
(5-min) - I spend 5 minutes to do self-reflection.
(15-min) - Journal 
8:30AM – Preparing to start my day.
(5-min) - I make my brain smoothie (Click here for my recipe…)
(10-min) - I make my to-do list for the day and prioritize based on the most important task.
(30-min) - Read (15-30 minutes)
(15-min) - Cook breakfast and Lunch
9:30AM – Time to get things done and be productive.
I start on my first-hardest task for the day and continue to keep checking off the things from my list. I alter as I go but by following the list, my mind tends to focus a lot better and produce the results I need.

The key is to… Start. When? The sooner the better. It might take some of you a week or two to get used to this routine, but I promise you, it gets easier. Why? because, once a habit is developed through daily repetition then, it becomes part of your routine. It is not a habit anymore rather, it’s part of your lifestyle! That is when it becomes natural and systematic in you. 

Results? After some time, I have started to notice that I become much happier each day and always looking forward to my days ahead. Why did I choose to develop this killer morning routine? Because I realized that in order to become better, I need to design my days better by implementing a winning routine that works for me. Furthermore, this has proven that by developing a good morning routine, you are setting your day up to win! 

Bonus: My Night Routine

Congratulations! Now that you know how to execute your day better, here’s the last part of it which is the icing on the cake. Remember to always complete these night routines to finish your day off before you go to bed!

Final words

Morning is the perfect time of the day for you to set yourself up for success. Each day comes with new opportunities for you to seize. By having the right daily routine, you would be able to see opportunities that come in your way. However, if you are not prepared, you will not see those opportunities and you will be stuck on where you are in life until you make the commitment to change.

In order to live happily and full of purpose, you need to design your own daily routine that works for you and unfortunately, that doesn’t happen by accident. YOU have to create it and work hard for it. It starts right at the moment when you wake up in the morning. This includes eliminating things that are holding you back or consuming most of your time. 

Remember, the key is to Start and know that everyone has to start somewhere. Even if you only start with a few simple disciplines today, this alone could change your life for the better. Don’t blame yourself for anything that you’ve done and always to have faith in yourself and know that if a lot of successful people can do it, you can do it too!
